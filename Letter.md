The goal of this challenge is to get the information that is blacked out. 

To do this, I simply looked to see if I could highlight the text under the black bar.
First I tried the username.

```
Username:........................... 
```

Ah ha, definitely on the right track! Let's check the password.

```
Password: â€‹CTF{ICanReadDis} 
```
Success! This was a great warm-up and a quick sense of accomplishment, but the challenges are going to get increasingly difficult as we progress!

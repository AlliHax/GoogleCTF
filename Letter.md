# Letter
You are given an attachment that contains a letter with credentials that are blacked out. The goal is to get the information from the letter that is blocked out.

My first thought was to see if I could highlight the text under the black bar.
First I tried the username. I highlighted the text and pasted it into a blank notepad.

```
Username:........................... 
```

Ah ha, definitely on the right track! Let's check the password.

```
Password: â€‹CTF{ICanReadDis} 
```
Success! This was a great warm-up and a quick sense of accomplishment, but the challenges are going to get increasingly difficult as we progress!
